summary: This blog post provides a comprehensive guide on configuring Flutter flavors to differentiate between development (DEV), (UAT) and live (LIVE) environments for apps targeting Android.

I’m using Flutter `v3.13.0` for this tutorial.

## Add a Flutter build configuration for each flavor in Android Studio

We want to have three flavors called `dev`, `uat` and `live`.

If you want to launch a flutter app with a flavor, you have to use the `flutter run --flavor <env>` parameter in the Flutter CLI. To automatically start the app with a flavor in Android Studio we need to change the build configurations:
- Find `main.dart` in the **Android Studio** top toolbar and select **Edit Configurations**.... This opens the **Run/Debug Configurations** window.
- Change the Name field to `dev`
- For Build flavor: set `dev` as well.
- Duplicate the dev configuration (It’s an icon in the top left of the window)
- Change the `Name` and `Build flavor` values to `uat` and `live`
- Close the dialog. Instead of `main.dart`, it will now display `dev` in the top toolbar.

***IMPORTANT: Flavor names may not start with `test` as that’s not allowed by Android.***

## Setup flavors for Android

### Add the flavor-settings to the Android build config

In Android, the native flavor-specific values are stored in `android/app/src/build.gradle` via the `android.flavorDimensions` and `android.productFlavors` keys.

We’ll use these keys to set up the flavor-specific applicationId and the flavor-specific display name for the app. This is important because we want to be able to have both flavors of the app installed at the same time.

The applicationId is the unique app id for each flavor in the Google Play store. Once deployed to Google Play, this can not be changed anymore!

Therefore, add the following two things within the android `{ ... }` section:

```
android {
    // ... all existing things like `sourceSets`, ...

    flavorDimensions "app"

    productFlavors {
        dev {
            dimension "app"
            applicationId "com.andy.cookify.dev"
            resValue "string", "app_name", "DEV Cookify"
        }
        uat {
            dimension "app"
            applicationId "com.andy.cookify.uat"
            resValue "string", "app_name", "UAT Cookify"
        }
        live {
            dimension "app"
            applicationId "com.andy.cookify"
            resValue "string", "app_name", "Cookify"
        }
    }
}
```

### Add the method channel in Android code

When the app starts, Flutter needs a way to ask the native platform which flavor it has been started with. To communicate with native code, Flutter uses `method channels`.

Go to `android/app/src/main/kotlin/<your>/<application>/<id>/MainActivity.kt` and replace everything except the first line (the package import) with the following code. This will set up the method channel that returns the BuildConfig.FLAVOR value, which is a built-in value of Android.

```kotlin
import androidx.annotation.NonNull;
import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity
import io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine
import io.flutter.plugin.common.MethodChannel
import io.flutter.plugins.GeneratedPluginRegistrant
import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity

class MainActivity: FlutterActivity() {
    override fun configureFlutterEngine(@NonNull flutterEngine: FlutterEngine) {
        GeneratedPluginRegistrant.registerWith(flutterEngine);

        MethodChannel(flutterEngine.dartExecutor.binaryMessenger, "flavor").setMethodCallHandler {
                call, result -> result.success(BuildConfig.FLAVOR)
        }
    }
}
```

### Adjust the App Name in the AndroidManifest.xml

Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

Replace the `<application android:label="<old_app_name>"/>` with `<application android:label="@string/app_name"/>`

### Setting App Icon 

Use [Icon Finder](https://www.iconfinder.com/) or [App Icon](https://appicon.co/) to generate App Icon. And place folder following: 

<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
  ![InfoPlist](/static/images/flavors/android_app_icon.png)
</div>

## Get the Flavor in Flutter Project

As described in our requirements, we want to target different API endpoints per flavor so we need a way to get the current flavor in our Flutter code.

We’ll first add a class called `AppFlavor` in a new file called `lib/app_flavor.dart` that will hold all of our flavor-specific settings that we only need in our Flutter code:

```dart
enum AppEnvironment { dev, uat, live }

class AppFlavor {
  static AppEnvironment environment = AppEnvironment.dev;
  static String apiBaseUrl = 'https://api-dev.cookify.io';

  static void setEnvironment(AppEnvironment env) {
    switch (env) {
      case AppEnvironment.dev:
        environment = AppEnvironment.dev;
        apiBaseUrl = 'https://api-dev.cookify.io';
        break;
      case AppEnvironment.uat:
        environment = AppEnvironment.uat;
        apiBaseUrl = 'https://api-uat.cookify.io';
        break;
      case AppEnvironment.live:
        environment = AppEnvironment.live;
        apiBaseUrl = 'https://api.cookify.io';
        break;
    }
  }
}

class AppFlavorHelper {
  static Future<AppEnvironment> getEnvironment() async {
    String? flavor =
        await const MethodChannel('flavor').invokeMethod<String>('getFlavor');

    print('STARTED WITH FLAVOR $flavor');

    switch (flavor) {
      case 'dev':
        return AppEnvironment.dev;
      case 'uat':
        return AppEnvironment.uat;
      case 'live':
        return AppEnvironment.live;
      default:
        return AppEnvironment.dev;
    }
  }
}
```

Next, we’ll use this in `main.dart`, where we’ll read the flavor via our method channel from the native platform and we’ll create the corresponding `FlavorConfig`. We’ll also have to make our main-method async for that.

When done, your `main.dart` as following:
```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  final environment = await AppFlavorHelper.getEnvironment();
  AppFlavor.setEnvironment(environment);

  runApp(const MyApp());
}

// ... class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
```

## Run the Android app
You can use these command-line or use **Android Studio** to build with build configurations
```bash
flutter run --flavor dev
flutter run --flavor uat
flutter run --flavor live
```

Now, launch the app in Android Studio with the `dev` build configuration.

Close the app in the device and check your application list, the app name will now display `DEV Cookify`!

Stop the app in Android Studio, change the build configuration to `uat` or `live` and launch the app again.

You’ll now have all flavors of your app installed on your Android device!
