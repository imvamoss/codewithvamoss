summary: This blog post provides a comprehensive guide on configuring Flutter flavors to differentiate between development (DEV), (UAT) and live (LIVE) environments for apps targeting iOS and Android.

I‚Äôm using Flutter `v3.13.0` for this tutorial.

## Add a Flutter build configuration for each flavor in Android Studio

We want to have three flavors called `dev`, `uat` and `live`.

If you want to launch a flutter app with a flavor, you have to use the `flutter run --flavor <env>` parameter in the Flutter CLI. To automatically start the app with a flavor in Android Studio we need to change the build configurations:
- Find `main.dart` in the Android Studio top toolbar and select Edit Configurations.... This opens the ‚ÄúRun/Debug Configurations‚Äù window.
- Change the Name: field to `dev`
- For Build flavor: set `dev` as well.
- Make sure ‚ÄúShare through VCS‚Äù is selected.
- Copy the dev configuration (It‚Äôs an icon in the top left of the window)
- Change the Name: and Build flavor: values to `uat` and `live`
- Make sure ‚ÄúShare through VCS‚Äù is selected as well
- Close the dialog. Instead of `main.dart`, it will now display `dev` in the top toolbar.

*IMPORTANT: Flavor names may not start with `test` as that‚Äôs not allowed by Android.*

## Setup falvors for Android

### Add the method channel in Android code

When the app starts, Flutter needs a way to ask the native platform which flavor it has been started with. To communicate with native code, Flutter uses `method channels`.

Go to `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/andy/cookify/cookify/MainActivity.kt` and replace everything except the first line (the package import) with the following code. This will set up the method channel that returns the BuildConfig.FLAVOR value, which is a built-in value of Android.

```kotlin
package com.andy.cookify.cookify

import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity

class MainActivity: FlutterActivity() {
    override fun configureFlutterEngine(@NonNull flutterEngine: FlutterEngine) {
        GeneratedPluginRegistrant.registerWith(flutterEngine);

        MethodChannel(flutterEngine.dartExecutor.binaryMessenger, "flavor").setMethodCallHandler {
                call, result -> result.success(BuildConfig.FLAVOR)
        }
    }
}
```

### Add the flavor-settings to the Android build config

In Android, the native flavor-specific values are stored in `android/app/src/build.gradle` via the `android.flavorDimensions` and `android.productFlavors` keys.

We‚Äôll use these keys to set up the flavor-specific applicationId and the flavor-specific display name for the app. This is important because we want to be able to have both flavors of the app installed at the same time.

The applicationId is the unique app id for each flavor in the Google Play store. Once deployed to Google Play, this can not be changed anymore!

Therefore, add the following two things within the android `{ ... }` section:

```
android {
    // ... all existing things like `sourceSets`, ...

    flavorDimensions "app"

    productFlavors {
        dev {
            dimension "app"
            applicationId "com.andy.cookify.dev"
            resValue "string", "app_name", "DEV Cookify"
        }
        uat {
            dimension "app"
            applicationId "com.andy.cookify.uat"
            resValue "string", "app_name", "UAT Cookify"
        }
        live {
            dimension "app"
            applicationId "com.andy.cookify"
            resValue "string", "app_name", "Cookify"
        }
    }
}
```

### Adjust the app_name in the AndroidManifest.xml

Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

Replace the `<application android:label="cookify"/>` with `<application android:label="@string/app_name"/>`

## Setup flavors for iOS

Make sure you enrolled `Apple Developer Program` to run app on physical devices.

Unfortunately, setting up flavors in iOS is more complex and we‚Äôll have to use XCode and its UI for most of the steps. 

Let‚Äôs try building our app with a flavor for iOS now to see, what kind of error we get:
```
flutter build ios --flavor dev

The Xcode project does not define custom schemes. You cannot use the --flavor option.
```

This means, that on iOS we have to rely on a feature called ‚Äúcustom schemes‚Äù to represent our flutter flavors. Setting them up requires multiple steps.

### Setup Configurations
Make sure the root `Runner` node is selected in XCode

In the main window, select the `Runner` node below `PROJECT` (NOT below TARGETS)

Select the `Info` tab

In the `Configurations` section, do the following:
- Rename `Debug` to `Debug-dev`
- Rename `Release` to `Release-dev`
- Rename `Profile` to `Profile-dev`
- Duplicate `Debug-dev` and rename it to `Debug-uat`
- Duplicate `Release-dev` and rename it to `Release-uat`
- Duplicate `Profile-dev` and rename it to `Profile-uat`
- Duplicate `Debug-dev` and rename it to `Debug-live`
- Duplicate `Release-dev` and rename it to `Release-live`
- Duplicate `Profile-dev` and rename it to `Profile-live`
- This means, for every flavor, we need a separate `Debug`, `Release` & `Profile` configuration.

<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
  ![Configurations](/static/images/flavors/ios_setup_configuration.png)
</div>

### Assign Build Configurations to Custom Schemes
Now we can set up the actual `custom schemes` by doing the following:

- Make sure the root `Runner` node is selected in XCode
- Select `Product -> Scheme -> Manage Schemes‚Ä¶` in the main toolbar.
- To setup the `dev` scheme:
  - Select the `Runner` scheme, click on the settings-icon in the top left and select `Duplicate`
  - Rename the scheme to `dev`
  - Make sure `Shared` is selected
  - Adjust the build configuration to the corresponding `-dev` version
<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
  ![dev Scheme](/static/images/flavors/ios_scheme_dev.png)
</div>

- Similar 

- To setup the ‚Äúlive‚Äù scheme:
  - Select the ‚ÄúRunner‚Äù scheme again, click on the settings-icon in the top left and select ‚ÄúDuplicate‚Äù
  - Rename the scheme to ‚Äúlive‚Äù
  - For each of the sections (‚ÄúRun‚Äù, ‚ÄúTest‚Äù, ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnalyze‚Äù, ‚ÄúArchive‚Äù) on the left, change the build configuration to the corresponding ‚Äú-live‚Äù version.
  - Make sure ‚ÄúShared‚Äù is selected
  - Close the dialog

#### Result
<div className="-mx-2 flex flex-wrap overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
  ![Manages Schemes](/static/images/flavors/ios_create_scheme.png)
</div>

## Code Blocks

Some Javascript code

```javascript
var num1, num2, sum
num1 = prompt('Enter first number')
num2 = prompt('Enter second number')
sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2) // "+" means "add"
alert('Sum = ' + sum) // "+" means combine into a string
```

Some Python code üêç

```python
def fib():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:            # First iteration:
        yield a            # yield 0 to start with and then
        a, b = b, a + b    # a will now be 1, and b will also be 1, (0 + 1)

for index, fibonacci_number in zip(range(10), fib()):
     print('{i:3}: {f:3}'.format(i=index, f=fibonacci_number))
```
